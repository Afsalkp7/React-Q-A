# React-Q-A ⁉
---------
LIBRARY AND FRAMEWORK
---------
- What is library and framework :- <br />
     Both frameworks and libraries are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems. <br />
- Differents between library and framework :- <br />
     Inversion of control :- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
---------
SPA
---------
- What is SPA ?  <br />
     A single-page application (SPA) is a webpage that dynamically interacts with the web browser by rewriting the current web page with data from  the webserver. As a result, the webpage does not reload during its execution and instead operates in a browser.If any changes occur in current page its only re render that element only does not reload entire page. it is cleint side rendering . Single-page Applications are perfect for creating dynamic, fast-loading websites <br />
- Difference between Single page application and multy page application :- <br />
     ▶ User experience : - <br />
               SPA provoid smoother and more responsive user experience since they only update portion of the page that have chenged , resulting the faster navigation and reduced latency .<br />
               MPA may have slower performance due to reload entire page
     ▶ Performance : - <br />
               SPA only fetch and render the neccessory data for each interaction so its tend to be efficient in data transfer and server load. <br />
               MPA may reqiure serve to genarate and serve complete HTML page for each request so its take higher serve load and slower performance
     ▶ Development : - <br />
               SPA can be more complex to develop and maintain , Especially for large application due to the need for client-side routing , state management and asynchronous data handling <br />
